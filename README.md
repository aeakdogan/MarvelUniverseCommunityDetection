Marvel Comics, together with DC Comics, have been for many decades the two
main comic book publishing companies in the world. Marvel Comics first became
popular during the Golden Age of comics.Some of the characters created in this period,
such as Spider-Man, Captain America, X-Men and Fantastic Four became worldwide
and have become cultural icons of the western society of the last forty years.

We looked at the Marvel Universe collaboration network,where two Marvel
characters are considered linked if they jointly appear in the same Marvel comic book.
This network is created artificially by Marvel’s writers especially by Stan Lee. However,
this network mimics real-life networks. A hero with its’ own title series appearing in an
issue of another hero’s series were common in the Golden Age period. Characters lived
their adventures in the same fictional cosmos, and they interacted each other like real
actors.Same villains and secondary characters would appear in comic books of different
issues and there were continuous references to the events that were simultaneously
happening, or had happened.

Most pairs of characters that have jointly appeared in the same comic book have
fought shoulder to shoulder or each other, or have had some other strong relationship,
like family ties, kidnapping and archenemies. Thus, this network has the same nature of
a real scientific collaboration network.

We have investigated communities in the Marvel Universe collaboration network.
It was interesting to compare our results with the knowledge we have about the Marvel
Universe. We have found many Marvel characters that were overlapping in many
communities because of the crossover of the Marvel characters in the comic books.
